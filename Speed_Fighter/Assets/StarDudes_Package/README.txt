Thank you for picking up the Stardudes Modular Asset Pack, or updating it!

I have made some changes to the project, there is now the option to use a custom shader that utilizes a player colour mask. This gives you access to making these characters any
colour that you want, while only using 2 texture maps, (a base texture and a mask). The original texture maps and materials are still there, however you can find the new ones in the Materials_Alt folder. 
If you decide to go with one method over the other, you can delete the other so I have left the original matierals and textures so you can make that choice yourself. The Stardudes_alt folder 
contains the character prefabs with the new materials already applied so you don't have to. 

Keep in mind if you decide to go with the new shader, and trim down on the number of textures in the project that you need to keep any base (grey) textures, and 
their corresponding playercolor mask texture. You can swap between the two scenes included in the Scene folder to view the differences between the two, I wasn't able to recreate the exact same
effect that is in the original textures, but it's good considering the advantages of the shader.

I have also unified all the scale factors for the models, configured all animations and character assets to work with HUMANOID rig definition among a few other housekeeping things.
You should be able to use outside custom animations no problem now.

I've also added a few more Animations. This update is mostly to get the pack over to Unity 5, but more content is on the way. There is one human head for now.



Sorry for the long time no update. I've been busy with work as this is a side project for myself. I imagine you understand. : )
